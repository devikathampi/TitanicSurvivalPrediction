# Titanic Survival Rate
<br> This project uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.</br>
Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

Using the patterns found in the train.csv data, this model predicts whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.The result is stored in my_submission.csv
